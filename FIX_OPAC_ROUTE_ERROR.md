# Fix Applied: OPAC Route Error Resolution

## Problem
The application was throwing a `RouteNotFoundException` with the error:
```
Route [opac.search] not defined.
```

This was occurring in the OPAC index template at line 13 where it was calling `route('opac.search')`.

## Root Cause
The OPAC routes were configured with nested route names like `opac.search.index` instead of the expected `opac.search` that the template was looking for.

## Solution Applied
Added a route alias to map `opac.search` directly to the SearchController's index method:

### Before:
```php
// Advanced Search routes
Route::get('/search', [\App\Http\Controllers\OPAC\SearchController::class, 'index'])->name('search.index');
```

### After:
```php
// Search routes - Primary search interface
Route::get('/search', [\App\Http\Controllers\OPAC\SearchController::class, 'index'])->name('search');
Route::get('/search/advanced', [\App\Http\Controllers\OPAC\SearchController::class, 'index'])->name('search.index');
```

## Files Modified
- `routes/web.php` - Added route alias for `opac.search`

## Verification
✅ **Route exists**: `php artisan route:list --name=opac.search` shows the route is properly registered
✅ **Server starts**: PHP development server starts without errors
✅ **Template access**: The route `route('opac.search')` now resolves correctly

## Additional Routes Available
The OPAC system now has complete routing for:
- `opac.search` - Main search interface
- `opac.search.index` - Advanced search (alias)
- `opac.search.results` - Search results processing
- `opac.browse` - Browse collections
- `opac.help` - Help pages
- `opac.index` - Homepage

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The RouteNotFoundException has been resolved and the OPAC interface should now load without errors.
